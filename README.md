# Simple-POS
A simple console-based Point-of-Sale program written in Python. Whatever sales happen will be copied to a "receipt.txt" file.

When adding to the inventory, you can also add examples in the form of a description and/or a sample, which should be in the form
of a URL. 

If you want to start off fresh, just delete all the data in the txt files in the inventory folder. Just be sure not to delete the
actual files themselves, or the program won't run.
